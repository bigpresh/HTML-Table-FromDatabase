Revision history for HTML-Table-FromDatabase

0.04    2009-07-23
        Add -override_headers and -rename_headers options, to allow the table
        headings to be customised easily.
        Pass the row hashref to callbacks, in case they need to look at the rest
        of the row in order to apply their transformation properly (this should
        not break existing code).

0.03    2008-11-19
        Add -html option, to allow HTML fetched from the database to be
        automatically stripped or encoded.

0.02    2008-08-21
        Add ability to provide callbacks to modify data on the fly
        as the table is being constructed.

0.01    2008-08-20
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
