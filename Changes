Revision history for HTML-Table-FromDatabase

1.11    2016-06-14
        Lowercase column names before prettifying them, so that Oracle users get
        same niceness (e.g. FIRST_NAME => 'First Name', not 'FIRST NAME')
        - thanks to Jared Still (jkstill) for this in GH PR-1 (hurrah, first
          pull request :)

1.10    2012-02-05
        New -auto_pretty_headers option, automatically prettifies column names -
        for example, "first_name" => "First Name"

1.03    2012-01-16
        Avoid uninitialised value warnings

1.02    2011-11-30
        Automatically add '&nbsp;' to empty cells to ensure browsers render them
        normally, unless the new '-pad_empty_cells' option is set to a false
        value.  This stops empty cells looking odd with no borders in many
        browsers.

1.01    2011-10-10
        Use HTML::Entities instead of CGI to encode HTML entities.

1.00    2011-05-24
        Add new -row_callbacks feature - allows you to define callbacks which
        are called once per row, given the hashref of row data which they may
        modify if required.
        Large version bump for the advantage of anyone who considers 0.xx
        software unready for production usage.

        Very minor release, finally applying patch kindly provided in RT ticket
        #51752 by by Frank Wiegand - thanks Frank!

0.06    2009-10-03
        Make the -override_headers and -rename_headers options work by applying
        patch supplied by Ireneusz Pluta in RT ticket #50164.
        Thanks Ireneusz!
        Also improved mock.t testes slightly.

0.05    2009-07-23
        Improve documentation, including the new -override_headers &
        -rename_headers options added earlier.

0.04    2009-07-23
        Add -override_headers and -rename_headers options, to allow the table
        headings to be customised easily.
        Pass the row hashref to callbacks, in case they need to look at the rest
        of the row in order to apply their transformation properly (this should
        not break existing code).

0.03    2008-11-19
        Add -html option, to allow HTML fetched from the database to be
        automatically stripped or encoded.

0.02    2008-08-21
        Add ability to provide callbacks to modify data on the fly
        as the table is being constructed.

0.01    2008-08-20
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
