HTML-Table-FromDatabase

Subclasses L<HTML::Table>, providing a quick and easy way to produce HTML
tables from the result of a database query.

I often find myself writing scripts which fetch data from a database and
present it in a HTML table; often resulting in pointlessly repeated code
to take the results and turn them into a table.

HTML::Table itself helps here, but this module makes it even simpler.

Row headings are taken from the field names returned by the query.

All options you pass to the constructor will be passed through to HTML::Table,
so you can use all the usual HTML::Table features.
